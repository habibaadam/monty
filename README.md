# The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## Requirements For Building Project

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

* All your files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89

* All your files should end with a new line

* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

* You are allowed to use a maximum of one global variable

* No more than 5 functions per file

* You are allowed to use the C standard library

* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h

* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file

* All your header files should be include guarded.

## Usage/Examples/Compilation

Your code should be compiled this way:
```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```
## Monty Bytecode Files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line.

There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account

## The Monty program

<b>root@a10e0d6b8089:~/monty# cat -e tryingbytecodes/0.monty.

push 1$

push 2$

push 3$

pall

root@a10e0d6b8089:~/monty# ./monty tryingbytecodes/0.m

3

2

1

root@a10e0d6b8089:~/monty# </b>

## Running Tests After Compiling

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
./monty </path/to bytecodefile>
```


## Running With Valgrind

To deploy this project against valgrind to detect memory leaks:

```bash
valgrind ./monty <path/to bytecodefile>
```

## Opcode Usage
```bash
<opcode> <integer> OR <opcode>
```

 Opcode       | Description/Job
------------- | -------------
push          | This opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
pall          | This opcode prints out all elements from the stack.
pint          | This opcode prints the value of the top value on the stack.
pop           | This opcode removes the top element from the stack
swap          | This opcode swaps the top two elements from the stack.
nop           | This opcode doesn't do anything.
pchar         | This opcode prints the char at the top of the stack.
pstr          | This opcode prints the string starting at the top of the stack.
rotl          | This opcode rotates the stack to the top.
rotr          | This opcode rotates the stack to the buttom.
stack         | This opcode sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO).
queue         | This opcode sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).


Arithmetic    | Description/Job
------------  | --------------
add           | This opcode adds the top two elements from the stack.
sub           | This opcode substracts the first and second elements from the stack.
div           | This opcode divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
mul           | This opcode multiplies the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
mod           | This opcode computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
